\section{Something About Me}
I am a first year PhD student in the UCCS. I am a photographer in my leisure time. I started this hobby from 2012. Throughout the past few years, I have helped friends recording the moments for their wedding, graduation parties, newborn baby, housewarming party, Halloween party, etc. When I travel, I enjoy capturing the beautiful nature. Beyond this, I like to disassemble and reassemble things then make improvements that fit my needs. If the product does not exist, I create my own. I sometimes play games with friends; this is a way of getting out of the busy life and relaxing and rebounding with friends. Snow ski and water ski are the two sports I enjoy. One is for winter and the other for summer. Here is a picture of me taken by myself.
