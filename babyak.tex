\section{Section 1}

My name is Lori Babyak.  I am a first year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs. I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from UT Austin and a Master's degree, also in Computer Science, from Texas State University. My goals for this course - CS 6000 Computer Science Research Methods- are to learn to research, read, and eventually produce research papers on subjects of interest in Computer Science. Additionally, I am looking forward to getting to know other students in the class and work collaboratively towards goals. Something personal about myself is that I have three grown children, two of whom live in the Denver area. Also, I took an extended vacation with a couple of friends in August. We visited Colorado Springs, Wyoming and South Dakota. In South Dakota, we visited Mt. Rushmore, the Crazy Horse Sculpture, and Custer State Park - where we saw free-roaming bison in their natural environment. I am happy and excited to be part of the UCCS community, and my hope is to make significant contributions to the field.

\textbf{Question  to Lori Babyak from Constance Hendrix}:  I traveled to Wyoming and South Dakota in July.  Did you have the chance to see Devils Tower?
\textbf{Answer to Question from Constance Hendrix}: We drove through Wyoming and stopped in Torrington.  We only had a couple of days in SD, so we visited Mt. Rushmore, the Crazy Horse Sculpture and Custer State Park.  I don't think we saw Devil's Tower. There's so much to see there!

\textbf{Question from Jackie}
Hi Lori, thanks for sharing. I went to those places twice. The first time was in 2013, and the second time was in 2018. To be honest, I did not see much progress on the Crazy Horse. My questions would be: since you are in Colorado Springs, are you going to snow ski? If you already did, how much you enjoy the mountain views at the top? the cog train is a fun ride, too.
